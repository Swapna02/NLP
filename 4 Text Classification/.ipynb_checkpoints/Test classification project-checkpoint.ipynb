. \\na shadow of last year's 'girl , interrupted' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'the cuckoo's nest' and 'trainspotting' . \\ndirector betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review . \\nfor some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy . \\njokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness . \\nand what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean . \\nisn't that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ? \\neven the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park . betty thomas' idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11 . \\nit is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously . \\nbut the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance . \\nthat it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story . \\n \" all you need to do is just say no \" , says dr . cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century . \\nand that's how simple it is ! \\nin fact i would rather watch 'lost in space' once again , than return to '28 days' . \\nas for acting , it's acceptable , but hardly anything else . \\nfor sandra bullock it's an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than 'speed' . \\nshe handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop . \\ndominic west shines as the source of gwenie's devilish temptations , but elizabeth perkins' and steve buscemi's great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters . \\nalthough intellectually 'girl , interrupted' was a greater achievement , '28 days' is superior in its visual aspect . \\nthere are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing , but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor . \\nthe most important thing is that we've seen it before and it was a lot better . \\n'clean and sober' , 'only when i laugh' , 'when a man loves a woman' , 'leaving las vegas' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues . \\nso what's the point ? \\nin other words '28 days' doesn't contribute to the moviemaking business on any level . \\nif you're caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you're standing in front of the movie theatre , you might as well go in and watch '28 days' . \\nunder all other circumstances stay away , because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost . \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",

       "neg    some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning , a live-action version of mr . \\nmagoo being a prime example . \\nthe cartoon figure mr . magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images . \\nif you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection . \\nfor a director they tapped hong kong's stanley tong , whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan . \\nthe story , such that there is one , is about a large , stolen ruby , which looks a woolworth reject . \\nmr . magoo gets it and , of course , does not realize he has it . \\nmayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr . magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased . \\nlike home alone 3 but without any class , mr . \\nmagoo can only be described as painfully bad . \\nfifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity . \\nthe movie's humor is pathetically lame , and the pacing is way off . \\nwhen one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture , one looks for some solace . \\nmr . \\nmagoo provides only three such moments . \\nthe movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character , who exudes his usual charm . \\nthe only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus , the sweet little bulldog . \\nangus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture . \\nfinally , the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie , which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked . \\nrather than attempt to adapt mr . magoo to a non-cartoon movie , nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon . \\nhe has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice , and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny . \\nmy wife managed to get some sleep during the movie , but i was not so lucky . \\nhopefully , this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not . \\nmr . magoo runs 1 : 37 . \\nit is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages . \\nmy son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the movie was good and really funny , but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie . \\nhe said he liked home alone 3 much more . \\nhis friend maxim , age 9 , said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense . \\nhis other friend nickolas , age 8 , said he'd give the movie * * * 1/2 , but that it was really silly . \\n

       "       so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? \\nwell , whatever it is , you'd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we're left with here . \\nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! \\nit's like i said . . . this \\nmovie sucks . \\nplot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . \\ncritique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . \\nuneven , would be another . \\nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it's actually going to go \" somewhere \" . \\nbut it isn't long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the \" pain \" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . \\nin a sci-fi movie ? \\nwell , i don't know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . \\nultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their \" misadventures in space \" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . \\nmind you , if you enjoyed that film's shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . \\nof course , i don't remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . \\nugh . \\nwhat a friggin' mess . \\nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . \\ndidn't anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? \\ndidn't they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain't saying much ! ) . \\nof course , you can't really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o'connell in this fine crew of thespians . \\n'nuff said . \\nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film's musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my \\nears hurt ! ) . \\nso is anything salvageable in this movie ? \\nsure . \\ngary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn't completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the \" sand-twister \" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . \\nother than that ? \\ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops , \\ndid i say \" admire \" , i meant \" am disgusted \" ! \\nall in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it's just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . \\ngo see the ninth gate . . . now \\nthere's a great movie ! \\nand on a personal note , i think it's time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
       "       so much for sweet returns . \\nafter smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80's slasher movies , starting with 1996's \" scream , \" and followed by \" scream 2 , \" \" urban legend , \" and the original , \" i know what you did last summer , \" a film like , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" was bound to be made sooner or late . \\nit is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out , and that is because they reached for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking , favoring non-stop deaths and gore for suspense , and trading in fleshed out , likable characters for one-dimensional nitwits . \\nit has been exactly one year since julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis , a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road , and then , thinking he was dead , dumped him into the ocean . \\nsince then , julie has relocated to boston university , and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams , she has been able to put her life back together . \\nwhen julie's friend , karla ( brandy ) , is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is , she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people , which also includes karla's horny boyfriend , tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend , ray ( freddie prinze jr . , also returning from the original ) , doesn't show up . \\nwhen they reach the secluded island , they discover it is the last day of the open season , and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them . \\nof course , julie , her friends , and the workers aren't the only ones there , as the murderous ben willis , dressed in fisherman garb , returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all . \\nit is a sad state of affairs when a movie like , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" is made . \\ni am a very big fan of horror movies , and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to \" ikwydls , \" which i am a fan of , is almost an exact replica of a \" friday the 13th \" movie . \\nwhile the original focused more on the story and characters , as well as genuinely suspenseful moments , thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson ( who didn't return to write the sequel , and it shows ) , \" i still know . . . \" \\nhas no story to speak of , and is so vacuous of ideas , that the filmmakers , were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested . \\nalso gone are any signs of character development , and since every single character died before i got to know them , all i was left with was to stare at the screen , indifferent to what was going on . \\nwhile i cared about the fates of the characters in the original , it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died . \\nthey were all paper-thin and pointless , except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman . \\nanother element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set-pieces , like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar , but there are none to speak of in this sequel ( although they do come close at one moment with brandy ) . \\nsince so many people were killed every couple minutes , the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water . \\nalso of note is the mystery of the second killer , and accomplice to ben , but it is obvious from the first frame who it is , and so i couldn't even have fun at that , like i did in the \" scream \" movies and , \" urban legend . \" \\nit figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again , a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else . \\nmaybe the people who made , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" should have realized that in order to make a good movie , you must have a screenplay---or at least one that isn't such a black hole for thoughts and ideas . \\nthe ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part , but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel , everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead . \\n

! ) are invading earth , destined to put an end to those \" man-animals \" to an end , and destroy earth once and for all , of course we have our typical hero ( played terrible by barry pepper , who was great in a small role in 1999's \" the green mile \" ) who is destined to go out , and save his planet ! \\none thing : he has to go up against , terl , the chief of security psychlo , who is played frankly , quite bad by john travolta , whom with dreadlocks , a big head , and green eyes just doesn't work . \\nof course the sidekick to terl , is played by ( lol ! ! ) \\nforest whitaker , who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind . \\nour friendly human johnny ( barry pepper ) looks just as bad as well , with long scraggly hair . \\ni'm not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film , except just to say it's terrible . \\neverything in this film is imcomprehinsable , from the make-up effects , which by the way aren't good , to the phony looking special effects , everything in this film is faulted . \\nin fact i don't remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time , or enjoying myself . \\nin fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed . \\nthroughout the entire 127 minute running time , i was dying , constantly looking at my watch , and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something , sadly it didn't . \\nmy advice to hollywood : get new scripts , new acting classes , better directors and damnit , make films like american beauty more . \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
       "pos    zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film . \\nzero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so ) . \\nhowever , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are . \\nzero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a \" normal \" guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator . \\nthe opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal ) . \\nit turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about . \\nzero takes the case , and the plot thickens . \\nhis path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) . \\ndespite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark . \\nthrough his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him . \\ni have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film . \\ni can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness ) . \\nzero effect , which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it's an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture . \\nwith so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . \\nbut he didn't just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment . \\ntake , for starters , the great cast of characters . \\npullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs . \\nzero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . \\npullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . \\nben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . \\n \" i'll shoot you , \" he says to stark at one point . \\n \" i have a gun , and everything . \" \\nhis character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . \\no'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . \\ni find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . \\nkasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . \\nit's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times . \\nthere's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . \\nwhat we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . \\ni can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . \\nas a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . \\nthere was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . \\ni have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone , but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest . \\njake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . \\ni found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . \\nhis direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . \\nzero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . \\nat the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . \\nand , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . \\n     1\n",
